We provide a safe space for individuals and groups to share and discuss their views and experiences regarding gender and sexuality and their multiple intersections with our lives in its different dimensions. We work towards building and strengthening links and ties between individuals and/or groups involved in these issues.</p><h2>A Brief History of Jeem:</h2><p>In 2018, Jeem was launched as a project of the Goethe-Institut, concerned with the production of critical and cultural knowledge on issues of gender, sexuality, the body and sexuality, outside the mainstream discourse of the dominant media.

With this privacy policy we want to transparently inform you about which personal data (\"your data\") we collect, process and use if you visit our website and/or use the Goethe-Institut website.</p><h3>1. Informational use of the website</h3><p>You can visit our website and use some of our internet offers without providing any personal information. Whenever a web page is called up, the web server merely automatically stores access data in so-called server log files which are automatically communicated by your browser. This includes data such as the name of the requested file, the last visited website, the date and time of the retrieval, the browser used, the amount of data transmitted, your IP address, the requesting provider etc. Within the scope of a processing procedure on our behalf, a third-party provider provides the services for hosting and displaying the website. This service provider is located within a country in the European Union or the European Economic Area.</p><p>For the purpose of a shorter loading time of our online presence, we also use a so-called Content Delivery Network (\"CDN\"), in which the website is delivered via the web server of a CDN provider working for us within the scope of order processing. Accordingly, access data is also collected on the web servers of the provider.</p><p>All access data is stored for a period of 7 days. This data is evaluated solely to ensure interference-free operation of the website, error analysis, and to improve our service. The use of a CDN provider, as well as the procedure described here, serves to safeguard our legitimate interests, which are predominant in the context of a weighing up of interests in accordance with Article 6 (1) lit. f GDPR regarding the correct representation of our offer.</p><h3>2. Registration user account</h3><p>You do not have to register as a user if you prefer to use the website anonymously. Only if you want to have a user profile which is displayed with submissions that you post on the website, you need to register.</p><p>For registration we process your registration data (email address and password), your user name and (if any) the avatar that you choose for your profile.</p><p>You need not provide your actual name. You may use a user name of your own choice so that third parties cannot determine your identity.</p><p>We process the data you provide by registration for the purpose of the performance of a contract according to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to provide the free services that we offer.</p><h3>3. Submissions, enquiries and reporting errors or issues</h3><p>You may voluntarily post &nbsp;information and content (so-called user-generated content), such as a photo of you, text in the form of comments or contributions on a message board, in webinars etc., and send enquiries or reports by email. You may do so without being a registered user.</p><p>In order to publish your submissions on the website, we process your profile information if you are a registered user (see section 3) and the content you submit. Otherwise we will process the content you submit anonymously.</p><p>If you send us an enquiry or a report of an error or an issue, we will process your email address and your message to handle your enquiry or report. We will not publish any messages you send us by email.</p><p>We process the data you provide by posting submissions or sending us email messages for the purpose of the performance of a contract according to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to provide the free services that we offer.</p><h3>4. Mailing lists</h3><p>If you subscribe to one of our mailing lists, we will use the information required or separately provided by you to periodically send you messages of the mailing list(s) that you have subscribed to.</p><p>The legal basis for sending you the mailing list messages is your explicit consent according to Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. For security reasons, we use the so-called double opt-in procedure: We will only send you messages of a mailing list by email if you have previously confirmed your mailing list subscription. For this purpose, we will send you an email confirming the subscription via the link contained therein. We want to make sure that only you as the owner of the specified email address can subscribe to the newsletter.</p><p>The messages of the mailing list are sent using Mailchimp, a service provided by The Rocket Science Group, LLC, 675 Ponce de Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA. For this purpose we transmit your email address to The Rocket Science Group, LLC, which processes this data on our behalf according to Article 28 GDPR.</p><p>The Rocket Science Group, LLC, is certified under the “EU-US Privacy Shield” Agreement. According to an Adequacy Decision by the EU Commission, an adequate level of protection is ensured when transmitting data to service providers certified under the “EU-US Privacy Shield” Agreement.</p><p>You may withdraw your consent to this use of your email address at any time by sending a message to the contact details provided below or by unsubscribing through a dedicated link which is contained in each email message.</p><h3>5.
